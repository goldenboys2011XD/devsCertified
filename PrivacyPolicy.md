# **DevsCertified Discord Bot Privacy Policy**

**Last Updated:** August 21, 2024

At DevsCertified, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the limited personal information we collect through our Discord Bot ("the Bot"). This Privacy Policy outlines what information we collect, how we use it, and how we protect it.

## 1. **Information We Collect**

The only information we collect through the Bot is:

- **Bot Logs:** We collect logs that contain pairs of Discord usernames and the corresponding legal names, which are used solely for the purpose of generating and issuing certificates.

We do not collect, store, or process any other personal information.

## 2. **How We Use Your Information**

The information we collect (pairs of usernames and legal names) is used exclusively for the following purpose:

- **Certificate Issuance:** Usernames and their associated legal names are used to generate personalized certificates based on the assessments taken through the Bot.

## 3. **Information Sharing and Disclosure**

We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal information to outside parties. The information collected is used only as described above and is not shared with any third parties, except under the following circumstances:

- **As Required by Law:** We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to a legal request, such as a subpoena or court order.

## 4. **Data Security**

We take reasonable precautions to protect the bot logs and any associated information from unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

## 5. **Data Retention**

The bot logs containing pairs of usernames and legal names are retained only for as long as necessary to issue the certificates. Once the certificates are issued, we do not store the logs for any longer than required by our operational processes.

## 6. **Your Rights**

Since we collect minimal data, your rights are similarly focused:

- **Delete Your Information:** If you wish to have your data (username and legal name pair in the bot logs) deleted after a certificate is issued, please contact us, and we will delete it as requested.

To exercise this right, please contact us at [info@goldencube.dev](mailto:info@goldencube.dev).

## 7. **Children's Privacy**

The Bot is intended for users who are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information.

## 8. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Your continued use of the Bot after any changes indicates your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.

## 9. **Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [info@goldencube.dev](mailto:info@goldencube.dev) or [https://discord.gg/MFN622GSqM](https://discord.gg/MFN622GSqM).
